# Ame60
a topmount/gummy oring?? 60% keyboard based off of Zlane's 'Kihon'. It is in the theme of the Vtuber Amelia Watson because I am a degen lol

***DISCLAIMER***
Use this at your own risk, I am making this open source because I want to spread this to other people, incase they want this. For information about screws and other stuff you can go check Zlane's post here https://github.com/Zlanee/Kihon. I just made a few adjustments, but most things should be the same.

You can ONLY use the flex cut solderable DZ60 pcb for this board, or else the gummy o ring posts will intefere with the pcb.

If you want to make this WKL or HHKB, you can go download the top from Zlane's github post itself.

Also the plate I provides in the file only supports tsangan 7u bottom, you can find the other plate file in Zlane's post as well

Any other questions, you can ask me in Discord - BenzBenz90#0720

I am also NOT responsible for any problems that you way encounter while purchasing this, you can try ask discords groups or dm me personally

Lastly, thanks for looking at my post!

(BTW, you read the name as 'a-mae', not 'aim')
