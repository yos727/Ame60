# Ame60
a topmount 60% keyboard based off of Zlane's 'Kihon'. It is in the theme of the Vtuber Amelia Watson because I am a degen lol

*DISCLAIMER*
Use this at your own risk, I am making this open source because I want to spread this to other people, incase they want this. For information about screws and other stuff you can go check Zlane's post here https://github.com/Zlanee/Kihon. I just made a few adjustments, but most things should be the same.

You can use any DZ60 or similar PCB which has the usb port on the left side of the case

If you want to make this WKL or HHKB, you can go download the top from Zlane's github post itself.

Any other questions, you can ask me in Discord - BenzBenz90#0720

Lastly, thanks for looking at my post!
